# NordVPN Server Picker

A simple tool to generate OpenVPN commands to connect to the fastest server in the current region (or the selected one).

It expects config files to have the same name as the one downloaded from [NordVPN's website](https://downloads.nordcdn.com/configs/archives/servers/ovpn.zip) and to be all in the same folder (tcp and utp together)
